# Global coding conventions

When writing code, you MUST follow these principles:

- Code should be easy to read and understand.
- Keep the code as simple as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, etc. Names should reveal intent.
- Functions should be small and do one thing well.
- Function names should describe the action being performed.
- Only use comments when necessary, as they can become outdated. Instead, strive to make the code self-explanatory.
- When comments are used, they should add useful information that is not readily apparent from the code itself.
- Do not add comments indicating changes made, future plans, or bugs fixed.
- Because this is so important, it needs to be repeated, do not add comments indicating changes made, future plans, or bugs fixed!

# Language coding conventions

## Python

Follow The Zen of Python

> Beautiful is better than ugly.
> Explicit is better than implicit.
> Simple is better than complex.
> Complex is better than complicated.
> Flat is better than nested.
> Sparse is better than dense.
> Readability counts.
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
> Although practicality beats purity.
> Errors should never pass silently.
> Unless explicitly silenced.
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
> Now is better than never.
> Although never is often better than *right* now.
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Additional principles:

- Use exception handling over conditional checks to handle unexpected behavior.
- Use Numpy style docstrings including parameters, return values, and exceptions thrown, if any.
